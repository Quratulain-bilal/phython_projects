# Cartoonify Image Using OpenCV

This project applies a **cartoon effect** to an image using OpenCV in Python.

## Features
- Converts a real image into a cartoon-style image
- Uses OpenCV's `cv2.stylization` function
- Simple and lightweight script

## Requirements
Make sure you have Python installed, and install the required library:
```sh
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage
1. Place your image in the project folder and name it **image.jpg**
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python cartoonify.py
   ```
3. The cartoonized image will be saved as **cartoon.jpg**

## Code Explanation
```python
import cv2  # Import OpenCV

img = cv2.imread("image.jpg")  # Read the image

cartoon = cv2.stylization(img, sigma_s=150, sigma_r=0.25)  # Apply cartoon effect

cv2.imwrite("cartoon.jpg", cartoon)  # Save the output image
```

## Output
- The script takes an input image and applies a cartoon filter to it.
- The processed image will be saved in the same directory.

## Example
**Input:** `image.jpg`
**Output:** `cartoon.jpg`

Enjoy cartoonizing your images! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
